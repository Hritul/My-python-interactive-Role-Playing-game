# My-python-interactive-Role-Playing-game

In this adventure, you are the hero.
Your choices, skills, and a bit of luck, will influence the outcome of the game.
An evil sorcerer is holding your fellow adventurers prisoners.
Will you succeed to free your friends from the castle dungeons, or peril trying?

In this project, I created an interactive fiction text adventure game in Python by using the basics of programming and of Python language.

### You can directly play the game by downloading mygame.exe file and running it on your system or you can paste the code and run it and play the game.
